feat: Nokturo v3.0.0 - Notifications rebuild + Session stability

Session stability:
- Removed aggressive 30s health check that caused false session timeouts
- Removed window focus handler that triggered sleep mode on alt-tab
- Added PKCE auth flow and stable storage key for session persistence
- Token refresh now preserves existing user data (no more avatar/name reset)

Notifications complete rebuild:
- New notifications table with proper schema (recipient_id, read boolean, dismissed)
- Added deduplication - no more duplicate notifications for same mention
- Clear All now dismisses instead of deleting (preserves history)
- Click marks as read instead of deleting (notification stays, loses red dot)
- Real-time subscription filtered per user (no more cross-user triggers)
- Created useNotifications hook for clean state management
- Created create-notification edge function with server-side dedup
- Updated sendMentionNotifications for new schema with type mapping
