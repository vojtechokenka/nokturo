# Deploy / Release Workflow

When the user says **"push live"**, **"deploy"**, **"release"**, or similar — they **always mean BOTH the desktop app AND the web**. Never deploy only one.

Do the following steps in order:

1. **Suggest the next patch version** (e.g. 4.8.2 → 4.8.3) — read current `package.json` version and bump the patch. Only use a different bump (minor/major) if the user explicitly asks. If user confirms (e.g. "ano"), proceed.

2. **Update `"version"` in package.json** to the agreed version

3. **Run `npm run electron:build:publish`** — GH_TOKEN is in `.env` and loaded automatically by the publish script

4. **Commit and push to `main`** — so Vercel auto-deploys the web. Stage relevant files, commit with message like `vX.Y.Z: <brief description>`, then `git push origin main`

5. **Confirm** the release URL on GitHub (e.g. `https://github.com/vojtechokenka/nokturo/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`) and that the web deploy will trigger via Vercel
